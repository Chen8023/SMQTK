SMQTK v0.2.2 Release Nodes
==========================
This minor release primarily adds classifier algorithm and classification
representation support, a new service web application for nearest-neighbors
algorithms, as well as additional documentation.

Also, this release adds a few more command line tools, especially of note is
``iqrTrainClassifier.py`` that can train a classifier based on the saved state
of the IQR demonstration application (also a new feature).


Updates / New Features since v0.2.1
-----------------------------------

Classifiers

  * Added generic Classifier algorithm interface.

  * Added SupervisedClassifier intermediate interface.

Classification Elements

  * Added classification result encapsulation interface.

  * Added in-memory implementation

  * Added PostgreSQL implementation

  * Added file-based implementation

  * Added ClassificationElementFactory implementation.

Data Elements

  * Added DataFileElement implementation the optional use of the tika module
    for file content type extraction. Falls back to previous method when tika
    module not found or fails.

Descriptor Elements

  * Moved additional implementation specific documentation into ``docs/``
    directory.

  * Moved additional implementation specific configuration and example files
    into ``etc/smqtk/``.

  * Moved ``PostgresDescriptorElement`` implementation out of nested
    sub-module into a single module in implementations directory.

Descriptor Generators

  * Removed ``PARALLEL`` class variable (parameterized in pertinent
    implementation constructors).

  * Added ``CaffeDescriptorGenerator`` implementation, which is more
    generalized and model agnostic, using the Caffe python interface.

Documentation

  * Added web-service documentation directory and moved applicable
    documentation files there.

  * Added more/better documentation on IQR demonstration application.

  * Added documentation on saving IQR state and training/using a supervised
    classifier based on it.

Tools / Scripts

  * Added descriptor compute script that reads from a file-list text file
    specifying input data file paths, and asynchronously computes descriptors.
    Uses JSON configuration file for algorithm and element backend
    specification.

  * Added tool for training a supervised classifier based on an IQR session
    state.

  * Added tool for classifying a sequence of input file paths, outputting paths
    that classified as the input label (highest confidence).

  * Converted ``iqr_app_model_generation.py`` to run as a command line tool with
    arguments, rather than an example script.

Web / Services

  * Added ``NearestNeighborServiceServer``, which provides
    web-service that returns the nearest `N` neighbors to the given
    descriptor element.

  * Added ability to save IQR state via a new button in web interface. This file
    is used with the IQR classifier training script.

Fixes since v0.2.1
------------------

Custom LibSVM

  * Fixed an issue where ``svm_save_model`` would crash when saving a 2-class
    SVM model.

  * Fixed an issue where ``svm_save_model`` would save an extra, unexpected
    file when saving a 2-class SVM model.

Descriptor Elements

  * Fix threading joining in ``elements_to_matrix`` (when using
    non-multiprocessing mode).

  * Fixed configuration use in ``DescriptorElementFactory.from_config``.

Data Sets

  * Removed ``is_usable`` abstract method. Redundant with ``Pluggable``
    base class.

Docs

  * Made ``sphinx_server.py`` executable.

  * Fixed whitespacing issue with ``docs/algorithms.rst`` that prevented
    display of ToC sections.

  * Updated/Fixed various class/function doc-strings.

Utils

  * Fixed ``smqtk.utils.plugin.get_plugins`` to handle skipping intermediate
    interfaces between the base class and implementation classes, as well as
    to skip implementation classes that do not fully implement abstract
    methods.
